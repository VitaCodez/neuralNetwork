This is a WITHOUT imported packages built neural network that can very accurately, MME=0.0001, predict sin(x). 
Sadly, it is not yet capable of training on a real dataset, the Boston House prices. I may try to solve this problem or move to another project, probably a neural network with sklearn, and there teach NN on a real dataset.
This project was for learning purposes, which I think it fulfilled. So if you would find this REPO, however, it would be I wish you fun with my halfworking NN.
